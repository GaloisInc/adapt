## Adapt Segmentation Component

- inmemory/ 
  - This folder Contains an implementation of a simple time-based segmenter for RDF graphs in Turtle format, with extensions to segment data in-memory read from a Titan database.
A quite detailed explanation of the segmenter functionality and installation instructions can be found at segmenter/doc/ and segmenter/README, respectively.

- segmenter/
  - This folder contains the current version of the segmenter, including support for performing segmentation on the database using queries rather than loading the data into memory.
