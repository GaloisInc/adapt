These example .provn files are taken from the infoleak example generated by
SPADE.  Each file can be ingested by Trint and translated to our CDM-inspired
internal data format.  Notice the .provn files are not complete - not all
possible Prov-N is generated by SPADE and not all statements generated by SPADE
have been 'plucked' from an available source and added to this directory.

# Manual Confirmation:

Each Prov statement is translated independently, so it suffices to consider the
translations in isolation.  To compare the internal form to the input prov use
trint's ast feature:

```
    Trint -a wasGeneratedBy.prov && cat wasGeneratedBy.prov.trint
```

In the generated .trint file, you can see there is a new node declaration and
two new edges.  The node declares the event while the edges connect the event to
the source and destination.
