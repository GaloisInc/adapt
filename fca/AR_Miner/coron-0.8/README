The Coron Data Mining Platform
==============================

CORON is a domain and platform independent, multi-purposed 
data mining toolkit, which incorporates not only a rich collection 
of data mining algorithms, but also allows a number of auxiliary 
operations. 
CORON also provides support for preparing and filtering data, and 
for interpreting the extracted units of knowledge.
